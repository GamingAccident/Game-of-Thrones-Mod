 string_start_yiti: "After the collapse of the §YGreat Empire of the Dawn§!, the §YEmpire of Yi Ti§! began. Since the end of the §YLong Night§! eleven dynasties of emperors have ruled over Yi Ti, each known by a color honorific. The transitions of power between dynasties did not always occur peacefully, and led to a prolonged period of §Ycivil war§! and anarchy. The longest of these lasted more than a hundred years.\n\nUnder the sea-green emperors, Yi Ti reached the apex of its power having §Yconquered Leng§! and §Yexacting tribute§! from Qarth, Old Ghis, Asshai, and other lands.\n\nDuring the past two thousand years, Yi Ti has often §Yfought against raiders§! of the Jogos Nhai. Many §Ygod-emperors§! invaded the Plains of the Jogos Nhai, but these attacks usually did not end well, as the Jogos Nhai would usually evade capture for such long periods of time that the Yitish invaders would give up and go home.\n\nIn the present day, Yi Ti is ruled from Yin by the seventeenth azure emperor, §YBu Gai§!. However, the amount of power he has is §Yweak§! compared to older god-emperors, and the local governors and tax-collectors have carved out a hundred princedoms among the provinces. In §YCarcosa§!, on the Hidden Sea, an exiled sorcerer lord resides, who claims to be the §Y69th Yellow Emperor§!. In addition, a general called Pol Qo has named himself the first of the §YOrange Emperors§!, using Trader Town as his capital."
